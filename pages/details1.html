          <h2>A bit about me ....</h2>
          <p>
            Hi my name is Jacqui, in a past life I worked for many years as a nurse and initially trained as a holistic massage therapist/ beautician in 1999. After a long career break to raise a family , I came full circle back to massage therapy. Over the last couple of years I have trained in hot stone therapy , pregnancy massage, deep tissue, sports and Indian head massage. I most recently worked as a therapist in Escape Spa at the New Park Hotel, gaining knowledge and skills from the amazing team there. And now I am taking my skills to Shambhala Holistics, where I can offer you a wide range of treatments to help you Rest, Restore and Revive in a nurturing environment.
            <br>Namaste
            Jacqui</p>
